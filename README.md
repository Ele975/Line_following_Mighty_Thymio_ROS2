# Line following using a Mighty Thymio through ROS2

The project consists in a Mighty Thymio which is able to automatically follow a line drawn on the ground. Different waved lines have been created to analyse the robustness of the code, starting from level 1 (smooth and large curves) to level 4 (tight curves). In addition two variations of the waved line of level 4 have been created to check also the behaviour of the robot with different line widths.
All these lines are used in 6 different scenes, and to make the project more interesting, an additional scene with obstacles along the path has been created in order to check if the Mighty Thymio is able to deal with more complex scenarios.
